Forkify Recipe App was developed as part of a JavaScript course on Udemy "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann. https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/

- **Favorite Recipes:** Users can save their favorite recipes, and these will be stored locally so that they can easily access them later.
